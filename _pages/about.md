Hello! I'm Soumi Maiti, a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I work at [WAVLab](https://www.wavlab.org/) and advised by [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe). I'm passionate about various aspects of speech and language processing, which includes speech processing, speech synthesis, speech enhancement, speech evaluation, and machine learning in general. During my doctoral studies, I primarily focused on high-quality speech enhancement using speech synthesis techniques. Currently, I am working towards speech generation using advanced language models and multilingual speech processing. 


## My background and history

I earned my Ph.D. from the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), where I worked in the [Speech Lab](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-09/SpeechLab.pdf), advised by [Micheal I. Mandel](https://mr-pc.org/). My dissertation work was on speech enhancement using synthesis techniques. I earned B.Tech. in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur. I have worked as a machine learning engineer at Apple within the Text-To-Speech team. I career journey also includes research experience as a graduate student researcher / internships at Google and Interactions LLC.
